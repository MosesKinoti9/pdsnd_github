Title:

US Bikeshare Project (Udacity Nanodegree Programming for Data Science using Python)

Description:

PyEx is a CLI program that takes US bikeshare data and enables analysis of data with ease by the user. The program is personalized to the user and data can be filtered according to certain variables: day, month and/or both.

The program also has a personalized feel as the user's string name and other input string values are used throughout the program to make it as fun and interactive as possible.

The user can also query for raw data that is displayed from the select dataset for further analysis.

The star feature implement is the exemption handling technique of a try..catch/except method that looks out for any wrong user input and sends a prompt to retry their entry without crashing the entire program. This eliminates the need for the user to begin the program afresh which can be frustrating and lead to a bad user experience.
